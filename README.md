## Introduction
Link is a networking library that fills the gap between UDP and TCP, allowing you to easily create complex, high-performance, low-latency applications.
It uses exclusively UDP, but implements important features found in TCP and allows the user to choose which features to use. Link solves the following problems:
* **Client and server connection**: Create server and connect with client(s) in just a few clean lines of code.
* **Packet creation and handling**: Easily write complex data to packets that can be just as easily read and handled on the receiving side.
* **Packet delivery methods**: Choose how your packet should be delivered over the network - allows you to enable duplication-prevention, ordering, reliability and fragmentation.

Link is written in pure `C#` and targets `.NET Standard 2.0`.
